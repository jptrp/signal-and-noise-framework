# Voice and Tone

## Voice
- Calm, precise, and deliberate
- Direct without being cold
- Focused on clarity and user control

## Tone Guidelines
Use a steady, informative tone in most contexts. Shift only when necessary:
- Tutorials: encouraging and practical
- CLI output: minimal and action-oriented
- Errors: neutral, specific, and fix-focused

## Language Patterns
- Prefer short sentences over long ones
- Use verbs that imply control: choose, record, decide, defer
- Avoid hype or exaggerated claims

## Do and Don’t

### Do
- "Capture decisions, not just summaries"
- "Local-first and git-friendly"
- "No automation without permission"

### Don’t
- "Revolutionary productivity system"
- "AI that manages everything for you"
- "Never lose context again" (overpromising)

## Naming
- Product: Signal & Noise Framework
- CLI: signal
- Directory: .signal/
