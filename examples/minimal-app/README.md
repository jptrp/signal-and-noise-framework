# Minimal App (Signal Practice)

This is a tiny Node CLI used to pick an app idea and practice Signal capture.

## Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Open the app

Open `index.html` in your browser.

## What it does

- Prompts you to pick (or type) a minimal app idea.
- Writes the chosen idea to `APP_IDEA.md` with a timestamp.
- Includes a one-screen habit tracker using localStorage.

## Signal practice

1. Review the options listed in the CLI.
2. Update the conversation node in `.signal/conversations/2026-02-12-minimal-app-idea.md`.
3. Set a path status in `.signal/paths/active.md` or `.signal/paths/deferred.md`.
