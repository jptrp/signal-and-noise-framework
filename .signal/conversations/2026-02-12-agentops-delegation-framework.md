# Conversation Node: AgentOps Repositioned as Delegation Framework

**Date**: 2026-02-12

**Participant**: You  
**AI Assistant**: GitHub Copilot  
**Project**: Signal & Noise  
**Status**: `active`

## Context

**What were you working on?**
- Strategic positioning for AgentOps within Signal & Noise
- Clarifying category and wedge for v1

**Why this conversation?**
- Capture a category clarification moment
- Formalize the core shift in definition and stack alignment

---

## Summary

**Type**: Category clarification moment

**Core Shift**:
- AgentOps is not an agent builder
- AgentOps is a formalized delegation framework for AI systems

**Root Problem Identified**:
- Humans delegate authority to AI without formalizing:
  - Scope boundaries
  - Intervention triggers
  - Escalation rules
  - Decision rationale

**Most Acute Wedge**:
- Product managers deploying AI features who do not know when systems should return control to humans

---

## Repositioned Definition

AgentOps = A system that defines and enforces explicit return-to-human conditions for AI systems.

---

## Core Components Emerging

### 1. Delegation Contract Layer (Design-Time)
- Role definition
- Scope boundaries
- Tool permissions
- Confidence thresholds
- Escalation rules
- Human ratification requirements

### 2. Intervention Trigger Engine (Runtime)
- Confidence floor detection
- Drift detection
- Scope violations
- Escalation events

### 3. Strategic Memory Layer
- Captures why delegation rules exist
- Records rationale behind threshold changes
- Links incidents -> decisions -> approvals
- Creates institutional memory for AI governance

**Clarification**: Lineage is not compliance logging. Lineage = strategic memory of delegation decisions.

---

## Decision Made

**Chosen Path**: Reposition AgentOps as delegation authority and intervention framework

**Reasoning**:
- Wedge is clear and urgent
- Aligns with Signal & Noise philosophy: operational clarity for human + AI systems
- Provides a concrete front door for product teams

**Next Actions**:
- [ ] Update AgentOps positioning copy to delegation framework
- [ ] Map delegation contract + intervention triggers to current roadmap
- [ ] Align Signal & Noise API as telemetry and reasoning engine
